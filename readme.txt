== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the plugin work? =

Every time an image is uploaded in the media library, WordPress automatically
creates alternative versions of that image, each with a different size
(thumbnail, medium, large and full).  Themes may then choose among these
different versions when displaying the an image in a post.

Thumbnails do also exist for featured images, and themes may registerd their
own alternative image sizes. For example, WordPress' default theme
TwentyFourteen defines a thumbnail size called "twentyfourteen-full-width"
whose dimensions are 1038x576.

This plugin uses the alternative-size information (which your theme uses for
rendering a featured image) for scaling and cropping external featured images
via CSS on your users' browsers.

There are some situations, however, in which this "size" information is not
provided. In these scenarios, our plugin relies on theme's CSS file. If the
CSS rules define the width and height of the featured image, everything should
be fine. Otherwise, you may have to tweak something.


= I don't see external featured images. What do I do? =

Try adding the following CSS code in your theme:

`
img.nelioefi {
  min-width:100px;
  min-height:100px;
}
`

and refresh your site. If you can see the external featured image, it means
that our plugin works properly, but some CSS tweaking was needed. Now, simply
edit the CSS styles of your theme so that the featured image looks good
everywhere (`width`, `height`, `max-width`, `max-height`).


= I added the CSS code you mention, but images do not appear yet. =

WordPress offers more than one function for inserting featured images.
Unfortunately, only one of them has a filter we can use. If your theme is not
using the `(get_)the_post_thumbnail`, then our plugin will not be able to
insert external featured images.

In these cases, the only solution is to tweak your theme and edit some PHP
code. Unfortunately, there's no generic solution for doing it. Just locate
where featured images are being inserted, and edit those lines so that it uses
the previous function (if possible). Please note that the plugin also offers
some helper functions that will ease the "tuning" of the theme (check the file
includes/nelio-efi-main.php to know them and review their documentation).
